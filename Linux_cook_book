				A SIMPLE CHEAT SHEET FOR BEGINNERS WANTING TO LEARN THE ROPES IN USING THE LINUX TERMINAL aka 
								PROGRAMMER'S HOLY GRAIL
===================================================================================================================================

on your computer, open the terminal using the main menu or ctrl+Alt+T and lets dive in ( all commands will be preceeded by >> but should not
be typed on the terminal. Its only for differentiation purposes)

NAVIGATION 

This is referred to as changing directories and uses the command cd to navigate into a folder
example, to navigate into a directory called Watches and this directory is within the current directory, type 
>>cd Watches

VIEWING(ls-list)

To view the contents of the current directory, type
>>ls 
if looking for contents in a particular folder X, you can do ls and upon determining the folder is in the current directory, cd into the directory.
SHORTCUT TO HOME

after performing cd severally and wish to go home, as a shortcut, type
>> cd ~
MOVE UP ONE DIRECTORY

if you are in level x and would like to go to level x-1 of your tree structure, type
>>cd ..
if you want to move 2 levels up, type 
>>cd ../.. and so on
DIR OPS

To create a folder, type
>> mkdir folder_name
to create more than one folder,
>> mkdir folder1 folder2
DELETING A FOLDER OR FILE(rm-remove)

for both, the same command is used but for a folder, certain parameters called flags are used
to delete a file,
>>rm file_name
to delete a folder,
>>rm -rf folder_name -r means recursively and thus, remove everything in the folder plus its self. ie, run the rm function recursively
-f means forcefully
RENAMING,COPYING OR MOVING A FILE OF FOLDER

Both use the same command since logically, its the same thing
RENAMING is the same as moving a file to a version of itself but with a different name for example,
to rename a file from name1 to name2,
>>mv name1 name2
for a folder,
>> mv foldername1/ foldername2
For moving, actual migration from one place to another, the equivalent of cut and paste
for a file,
>>mv filename path/to/destination
where the path can start from the root of the directory structure or the current working directory
for a folder, the -r flag is used such that all the contents of the folder are moved.
>>mv -r foldername1/ path/to/destination

Copying is the same as copy and paste. exact same format as move but instead of mv, use cp
for a file,
>>cp filename path/to/destination
where the path can start from the root of the directory structure or the current working directory
for a folder, the -r flag is used such that all the contents of the folder are also copied.
>>cp -r foldername1/ path/to/destination

WHERE AM I?

To know at what point of the directory structure you are in, type
>>pwd
which stands for Print Working Directory. This gives you the path to the current directory
CREATING A FILE

There are two ways using the terminal's editor called nano or using a more GUI like editor called gedit which comes with the OS
to create a file using nano, you will be typing in the terminal and with gedit, on a new window
for nano,
>> nano file.txt
for gedit,
>>gedit file.txt

VIEWING THE CONTENTS OF A FILE

to view the contents of a simple file, one that can be viewed by an editor,type
>>cat file_name
to output the contents of the file or 2 or more files to a new file,
>> cat file_name > newfile.txt
or
>> cat file1 file2 >newfile.txt
FILE LISTING
To view all files including hidden files,us the -a flag
>>ls -a
To get the long liat view of a file, ie, view ownership and permissions,
>>ls -l file.txt
To view the octal dump of a file, ie, the contents of a file in octal,
>>od -c file.txt the -c flag is for count, it will count the number of characters in the file.
Speaking of count, ever wondered of a way to determine the word count in a file? Say no more
>> wc file.txt will do the trick
Ever had a large file and are looking for a certain line with a certain word? The grep command helps you to find occurences of words in one or more files
>> grep searchword file.txt 
where searchword is the word youre looking for. To include the line number on which the word occurs, 
>>grep -n searchword file.txt
To search in every file in the current directory,
>>grep -n searchword *

FILE PERMISSIONS

In the UNIX system, files have permissions where a file can be restricted to a certain group of people who can perform limited functions on a file.
The functions are, Read (r) Write (w) and Execute(x).
There are three permission classes. The owner(who created the file), the owner's group and others(users not in the owner's group)
To assign permissions, the chmod(change mode) command is used. Symbolic representation is used to assign permissions.
4-READ 
2-WRITE 
1-EXECUTE
these numbers can be combined in any form to assign a desired permission or set of permissions eg, 7(4+2+1) gives all the permissions ie, the user or group can read,write and execute the file.
by default, the owner gets all the permissions.
in using chmod, the syntax is chmod followed by a 3 digit number which assigns permissions to the user, group and others respectifully.
a common configuration is 754 where the owner has all permissions, the group can read and execute but cant write and the others can only execute.
eg,
>>chmod 761 file.txt 
if upon doing an ls -l on a file you see a dash(-) this means that in its place, there is no assigned permission such as,
-rw-rw-r-- 1 kimz kimz 262 Jul 26 16:26 token.txt.....user cant execute, same to group, others cant write or execute...can only read
Lastly, before the permission symbols, a character is placed to identify a file type. if the character is a hyphen(-), the file is a normal, simple file.
If it is a letter, the file in question is a special file handled by the OS in a special way. eg, a directory will have the letter d
