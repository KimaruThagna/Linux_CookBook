				A SIMPLE CHEAT SHEET FOR BEGINNERS WANTING TO LEARN THE ROPES IN USING THE LINUX TERMINAL aka 
								PROGRAMMER'S HOLY GRAIL
===================================================================================================================================

on your computer, open the terminal using the main menu or ctrl+Alt+T and lets dive in ( all commands will be preceeded by >> but should not
be typed on the terminal. Its only for differentiation purposes)

NAVIGATION 

This is referred to as changing directories and uses the command cd to navigate into a folder
example, to navigate into a directory called Watches and this directory is within the current directory, type 
>>cd Watches

VIEWING(ls-list)

To view the contents of the current directory, type
>>ls 
if looking for contents in a particular folder X, you can do ls and upon determining the folder is in the current directory, cd into the directory.
SHORTCUT TO HOME

after performing cd severally and wish to go home, as a shortcut, type
>> cd ~
MOVE UP ONE DIRECTORY

if you are in level x and would like to go to level x-1 of your tree structure, type
>>cd ..
if you want to move 2 levels up, type 
>>cd ../.. and so on
DIR OPS

To create a folder, type
>> mkdir folder_name
to create more than one folder,
>> mkdir folder1 folder2
DELETING A FOLDER OR FILE(rm-remove)

for both, the same command is used but for a folder, certain parameters called flags are used
to delete a file,
>>rm file_name
to delete a folder,
>>rm -rf folder_name -r means recursively and thus, remove everything in the folder plus its self. ie, run the rm function recursively
-f means forcefully
RENAMING,COPYING OR MOVING A FILE OF FOLDER

Both use the same command since logically, its the same thing
RENAMING is the same as moving a file to a version of itself but with a different name for example,
to rename a file from name1 to name2,
>>mv name1 name2
for a folder,
>> mv foldername1/ foldername2
For moving, actual migration from one place to another, the equivalent of cut and paste
for a file,
>>mv filename path/to/destination
where the path can start from the root of the directory structure or the current working directory
for a folder, the -r flag is used such that all the contents of the folder are moved.
>>mv -r foldername1/ path/to/destination

Copying is the same as copy and paste. exact same format as move but instead of mv, use cp
for a file,
>>cp filename path/to/destination
where the path can start from the root of the directory structure or the current working directory
for a folder, the -r flag is used such that all the contents of the folder are also copied.
>>cp -r foldername1/ path/to/destination

WHERE AM I?

To know at what point of the directory structure you are in, type
>>pwd
which stands for Print Working Directory. This gives you the path to the current directory
CREATING A FILE

There are two ways using the terminal's editor called nano or using a more GUI like editor called gedit which comes with the OS
to create a file using nano, you will be typing in the terminal and with gedit, on a new window
for nano,
>> nano file.txt
for gedit,
>>gedit file.txt

VIEWING THE CONTENTS OF A FILE

to view the contents of a simple file, one that can be viewed by an editor,type
>>cat file_name
to output the contents of the file or 2 or more files to a new file,
>> cat file_name > newfile.txt
or
>> cat file1 file2 >newfile.txt
